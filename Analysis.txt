Task0
*******************
O(1) - Not dependent on inputs.

Task1
**********************
O(n^3) - Worst case is that it would have to loop through all the entries 3 times if they were all unique numbers.

Task2
**********************
O(n^3) - Worst case is that it would have to loop through all the entries 3 times if they were all unique numbers.


Task3
**********************
O(n) - One loop through all calls. Other loops are small in comparison to the length of call list.

Task4
**********************
O(n^3) - If all the texts were sent to and from unique numbers, it would have be two nested loops through all texts.
